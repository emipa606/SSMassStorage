--- Original Description ---
SS Mass Storage is an endgame storage solution for storing up to 2 147 483 647 items of the same kind which couldn't possibly fit in any stockpile. It sucks items from the stockpile it is in and adds it to its internal storage.

Like a Deep Storage Unit in Minecraft, it can internally store up to exactly 2 147 483 647 items. It can also store 300 items on top of itself, making it 2 147 483 947 items altogether.

It consumes 100W power when idle, 300W power with 10 items stored, 900W with 100, 2700W with 1000 items, 8100W with 10 000 items etc.

====RESEARCH====
This is NOT an earlygame item. It is a transcendent research after Shipbuilding Basics. Also, its power consumption cumulatively increases as more items are stored in it.

====HOW TO USE====
After research, place building on top of stockpile. Then, set its storage settings. It will proceed to suck in any items that you have allowed into itself.

You can see how many items are stored internally by selecting it.

====MOD CONFLICTS====
None. (duh it's just a machine)</description>
